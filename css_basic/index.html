<h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
<P>Hi, I'm Richard Gitau, a passionate front-end developer currently studying at ALX.<br>
   With a keen eye for design and a love for creating seamless user experiences,<br> 
   I strive to bring ideas to life through code.<br> 
   Growing up in Nairobi, Kenya, I've always been fascinated by technology and its power to transform lives.<br> 
   My mission is to empower businesses and individuals by building intuitive and responsive web applications.<br> 
   When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new design trends or volunteering in my local community.<br>
    Let's connect and create something amazing together!</P>
